WebDataParse is a spider software that can quickly obtain relevant data information from the NCBI nucleotide database. The premise is that there needs to be a series of GenBank numbers. Through the information provided in the database, such as information like sequence, species, host, reference, journal, sequence length, date, etc., we can quickly query and write to the local MySQL database.
